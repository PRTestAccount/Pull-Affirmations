# Pull Affirmations

This repository exists to let GitHub users practice pull requests. The workflow will auto-accept pull requests that contain only .txt files with the total size less than 5kb. If your request meets this simple criteria, the pull request will be accepted and a positive affirmation from the affirmations.txt file will be the comment on acceptance.
